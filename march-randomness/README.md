## General Information

"Teams use their probability intuition to predict the outcome of simple random experiments that use dice, balls, cards, and coins, placing StatCoin bets on their predictions to stay in play and take the lead. The competition offers separate categories for high school students and college students â€” no advanced math or stats required." (from https://thisisstatistics.org/march-randomness)

## Instructions

Run `make` to build everything. Then run `bin/roundX` (replace X with the round you want to run) to run a program. Simple!

Sample output can be found in `sample-output` as `.txt` files if you either can't build the programs or just don't want to.

## Challenges

#### Round 1

Roll a 20-sided die and a 30-sided die. Will the sum of the results be at least 20?

#### Round 2

Flip a coin four times. Will you get heads exactly one time?

#### Round 3

A pouch has two blue balls and two red balls. Shuffle and take out two balls at random. Will both of them be red?

#### Round 4

Roll a 6-sided die six times. Will you roll a 2 at least one time?

#### Round 5

A pouch has one green ball and nine red balls. Shuffle and take out three balls at random. Will all three be red?

#### Round 6

Two red cards have an A on the back, and two red cards have a B on the back. Two green cards have an A on the back, and one green card has a B on the back. Shuffle the cards and select one red and one green at random. Will both cards have the same letter on the back?

#### Round 7

Roll a 10-sided die five times. Will you get the same number at least twice in a row?

#### Round 8

Pouch A has one blue ball and three red balls. Pouch B has four blue balls. Pouch C has four red balls. Without looking, take two balls from Pouch A and put them in Pouch B. Shuffle Pouch B and without looking, take two balls from Pouch B and put them in Pouch C. Shuffle Pouch C and without looking, take two balls from Pouch C. Will they both be red?

#### Round 9

Flip a coin six times. Will the results be 4-2 for one side of the coin?

For example, four heads and two tails in any order would be a "yes," or four tails and two heads in any order would be a "yes," any other combination would be a "no."

#### Round 10

Pouch A has two blue balls and one red ball. Pouch B has three blue balls. Pouch C has three red balls. Without looking, take two balls from Pouch A and put them in Pouch B. Shuffle Pouch B and without looking, take two balls from Pouch B and put them into Pouch C. Finally, shuffle Pouch C and without looking take one ball from Pouch C. Will it be red?

#### Round 11

Roll a 10-sided die, then roll a 20-sided die, then roll a 30-sided die, keeping track of each result in order. Will the results be in strictly increasing order?

#### Round 12

A pouch has three blue balls and nine red balls. Shuffle and take out two balls at random. Will both be red?

#### Round 13

Roll four 6-sided die. Will there be a combination of at least two dice that forms exactly sum 8?

#### Round 14

Two red cards have an A on the back, and two red cards have a B on the back. Two green cards have an A on the back, and one green card has a B on the back. Shuffle the cards and select one red and one green at random. Will both cards have an A on the back?

#### Round 15

Roll a 20-sided die four times. Will you roll a 19 or a 20 at least one time?

#### Round 16

A pouch has six blue balls and one red ball. Shuffle and take out four balls at random. Will the red ball be taken out?
